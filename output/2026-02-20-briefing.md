## SIGNAL: Silver juniors explode +3.4% as trade war reality hits

US trade deficit held at $901 billion in 2025 despite Trump tariffs — businesses shifting away from China but imports aren't falling. The tariff strategy isn't reducing the deficit, it's reshaping supply chains and driving inflation. Meanwhile, silver juniors (SILJ) ripped 3.4% as the gold/silver ratio compressed to 62.76x.

**What it means:** Trade wars are inflationary, not deflationary. Reshoring and friend-shoring cost more than Chinese manufacturing. Silver is waking up to this reality — industrial demand meets monetary demand as the debasement accelerates.

**Action:** SILJ breakout validates the silver thesis. Gold/silver ratio below 63x for first time in months. If you're underweight silver miners, this is your signal. Uranium also strong (+1.8%) on coal revival headlines — power demand surging.

**Next catalyst to watch:** Core PCE next Friday. If it prints hot, silver miners could really fly.
