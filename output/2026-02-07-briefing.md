## SIGNAL: Silver explodes 5.25% as ratio collapses toward 64x

Silver ripped to $76.90 while gold climbed 3.07%, crushing the gold/silver ratio from recent highs. SILJ rocketed 7.23% as junior miners caught fire. This is the monetary reset accelerating — silver's industrial demand meets store-of-value panic buying.

Uranium joined the party with URA up 6.21% and URNM +4.38%. The nuclear buildout thesis is gaining steam with news of Navy reactors moving to land deployment.

**What it means:** The precious metals breakout confirms our thesis that real assets are repricing higher as fiat confidence cracks. Gold at $4,979 per ounce shows we're deep in monetary regime change.

**Action:** Hold all PM positions. Silver's outperformance validates the ratio trade. Add to uranium miners on any weakness — nuclear infrastructure is becoming geopolitical necessity.
