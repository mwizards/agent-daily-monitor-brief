# Energy Macro Morning Briefing — January 31, 2026

## SIGNAL: PRECIOUS METALS MASSACRE — Silver crashes 28%, Gold down 10%

Kevin Warsh Fed nomination expectations are obliterating real assets. Silver leading the selloff with a 28.5% single-day collapse to $75.44. Gold down 10.3% to $444.95. Uranium and copper miners joining the carnage with 8-10% drops across the board.

Market betting Warsh brings hawkish credibility that could actually tame inflation. Wrong read. Fed can't shrink balance sheet meaningfully without breaking something. This is a liquidation event, not a regime change.

**What it means:** Warsh or no Warsh, the structural inflation drivers remain intact — energy scarcity, deglobalization, fiscal dominance. The Easy Money Era didn't end because Powell got religion. It ended because reality forced their hand.

**Action:** This is what capitulation looks like. Hold core positions. If you have dry powder, silver under $80 is generational. Gold/silver ratio spiking to 60.4x — massive reversion opportunity brewing.

**Next catalyst to watch:** February FOMC. If Warsh confirmed, watch for actual policy details vs. market fantasies.
