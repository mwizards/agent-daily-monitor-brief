## SIGNAL: Silver rockets +7.9% as Supreme Court blocks Trump tariffs

Silver hit $76.62 as markets digest the Supreme Court's landmark ruling against Trump's tariff regime. The White House pivot toward "token" nuclear enrichment offers with Iran signals de-escalation from war footing. Silver miners (SILJ) up 4.5%, copper miners (COPX) +3.4% as industrial metals surge on tariff uncertainty.

**What it means:** The Easy Money playbook is breaking down in real time. Tariffs were the last tool to keep the dollar strong without destroying domestic industry. Supreme Court just removed it. Expect currency debasement acceleration as fiscal dominance takes over.

**Action:** Silver's move validates the thesis perfectly. Gold/silver ratio at 61.7x still has room to compress toward our sub-30x target. Hold all precious metals positions. If you're underweight silver relative to gold, this pullback in the ratio is your entry signal.

Gold $5,080 (+2.0%) | Silver $76.62 (+7.9%) | Copper $89.09 (+3.5%) | Uranium $73.49 (+1.2%) | UUP $27.09 (-0.1%) | 10Y 4.08% | SPY $689.43 (+0.7%)
