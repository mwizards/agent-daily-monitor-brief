## SIGNAL: Silver rockets +5.6% as monetary metal catches fire

Silver blasted through $78/oz with SLV surging 5.6% to $70.09. Silver juniors (SILJ) up 3.7%. Gold/silver ratio collapsed to 63.86x — lowest reading since the Easy Money Era ended. Fed dissent growing over rate hikes as inflation refuses to die.

**What it means:** The monetary metals are pricing in currency debasement acceleration. Silver's industrial + monetary demand is creating the perfect storm we've been positioning for. When silver moves like this, it's not retail buying — it's institutions hedging.

**Action:** SILJ position printing. Hold all precious metals exposure. If you're underweight silver vs gold, this breakout validates rebalancing toward the white metal.
