## SIGNAL: Silver explodes +7.9% as war premium returns

Silver ripped to $76.62 while copper miners surged 3.45% as Middle East tensions escalate. Ford Carrier Group enters Mediterranean for biggest US military buildup since Iraq 2003. Iranian Starlink black market prices soaring as Israel preps hospitals for retaliation.

Supreme Court struck down Trump's reciprocal tariffs, but the inflationary damage is done — businesses now scrambling for refunds while supply chains remain fractured.

**What it means:** War premium + monetary debasement = real assets moonshot. Gold/silver ratio crushing toward our sub-30x target at 61.7x. This is exactly what we've been positioned for.

**Action:** Silver juniors (SILJ) up 4.51% — let it run. Add to copper exposure on any pullback. Energy flat today but war risk supports the entire thesis.
