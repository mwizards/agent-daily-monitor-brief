## SIGNAL: Silver crater 11.5% on Russian re-dollarization proposal

Silver got absolutely demolished — down 11.5% to $67.73 — after reports Russia proposed returning to dollar settlements for commodities trade. Silver juniors (SILJ) down 9%. The entire precious metals complex cracked: gold -3.5%, all uranium and copper miners down 3-4%.

**What it means:** If Russia pivots back to dollars, it kills the de-dollarization trade that's been driving precious metals higher. Gold/silver ratio spiked to 63.7x — still way above the historical 16x mean, but the momentum just reversed hard.

**Action:** This could be the shakeout before the real move higher, or the start of a deeper correction. Hold core positions but watch for follow-through selling next week. If this was just headlines and Russia backtracks, silver should bounce violently.

Meanwhile, Asia faces an LNG supply crunch (Inpex warning) and crude stocks drew 819k barrels. Energy infrastructure thesis intact even as metals get hit.
