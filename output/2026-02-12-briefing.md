## SIGNAL: Silver explodes 4.3% as tariff revenues surge 300%

Silver hit $76.56 while tariffs generated 300%+ more revenue than expected. The Supreme Court decision looms, but trade war escalation is accelerating monetary debasement faster than markets anticipated. Gold/silver ratio compressed to 61x — still 2x above our target.

**What it means:** Fiscal dominance accelerating. Treasury needs Fed accommodation to fund expanded government operations. Real assets responding to debasement reality.

**Action:** SILJ and SLV positions performing exactly as expected. Hold all precious metals. Consider adding on any pullback below $70 silver.

**Secondary signals:** Japan restarts world's largest nuclear plant post-Fukushima. Uranium positions (URNM, URA) gaining momentum as global nuclear restart accelerates. Energy infrastructure thesis playing out in real time.
