## SIGNAL: Real assets explode 6%+ across the board as monetary chaos accelerates

Gold smashed through $5,000 to hit $5,077/oz while silver rockets to $89. The Bundesbank just delivered a vote of no confidence in global monetary stability — central bank panic is spreading. Fed's Miran calling for "aggressive rate cuts" while yields rise signals complete policy incoherence.

**What it means:** The debasement trade is accelerating faster than expected. When Germany's central bank questions monetary stability, you know the 40-year bond bull market is truly dead. This isn't a correction — this is regime change.

**Action:** Power Portfolio holders stay the course. If you're underweight precious metals, today's 6%+ move is expensive but the trend is your friend. URNM and URA leading the charge confirms nuclear renaissance is real.

**Gold/Silver ratio:** 56.9x and falling fast toward our sub-30x target. Silver outperformance is just beginning.
