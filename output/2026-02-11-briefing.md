## SIGNAL: Silver crashes 3.46% as gold/silver ratio spikes to 60x

Silver got hammered while gold held relatively steady, pushing the gold/silver ratio back above 60x. This is profit-taking after silver's monster run, not a breakdown of the monetary debasement thesis. At $84.75/oz spot, silver is still up 180% from pre-2024 levels.

**What it means:** Volatility is the price of admission in precious metals during monetary regime change. The 60x ratio remains far above the historical 16x mean — silver is still massively undervalued relative to gold.

**Action:** Hold SILJ and SLV positions. Use any further weakness to add. The uranium sell-off (URNM -2.33%, URA -2.55%) looks like sympathy selling despite Holtec filing for IPO — a bullish long-term signal for nuclear infrastructure.

Housing data showing "slowest price growth since Great Recession" confirms the real economy is cracking under higher rates. Powell's inflation fight is working — too well.
