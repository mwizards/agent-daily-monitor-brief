## SIGNAL: Precious metals crater 4% as dollar surges to 117.90

Gold crashed 4% to $4,940/oz while silver fell 3.98% to $86.25/oz — the worst single-day drop in months. Dollar strength (DXY +0.46% to 117.90) is crushing everything priced in dollars. Uranium miners (URNM) down 3.58% in sympathy selling.

**What it means:** This is technical washout, not thesis breakdown. Gold/silver ratio at 57.28x still screams silver undervaluation versus historical 16x mean. The debasement thesis hasn't changed — we're just seeing violent short-term moves in an unstable monetary system.

**Action:** Power Portfolio holders should view this as opportunity. SILJ at $31.52 is gift-wrapped. Don't chase today, but any further weakness in precious metals is buying territory. Uranium pullback also creates entry points in URA/URNM.

The geopolitical backdrop remains bullish — Iranian nuclear talks, Russian military escalation, and domestic political chaos all support real asset premium long-term.
