## SIGNAL: Silver crashes 16% as Chinese billionaire launches coordinated short attack

Silver got nuked. Down 16% to $66.69 after Beijing's "Anti Hunt Brother" billionaire launched what appears to be a coordinated short assault on precious metals markets. SILJ juniors down 9%, all uranium names bleeding 6%+, copper miners hammered.

This isn't fundamentals — this is financial warfare. China knows silver is the West's industrial Achilles heel. They're weaponizing paper markets to shake out Western hands before supply shortages bite harder.

**What it means:** The thesis is being stress-tested in real time. Physical silver demand remains insatiable while paper markets get manipulated. Gold/silver ratio spiked back to 66x — exactly where we want to be buying the dip.

**Action:** If you've got dry powder, this is what we've been waiting for. Silver at these levels with ratio above 65x is a gift. Hold core positions, add on weakness if you can stomach volatility.
