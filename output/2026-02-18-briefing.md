# Energy Macro Morning Briefing — February 18, 2026

## SIGNAL: Precious metals collapse 3-5% on UK disinflation data

Silver led the rout down 4.8% to $66.37, gold dropped 3.12% to $448.20. UK inflation cooling "markedly" in January triggered rate cut speculation, sending the dollar higher and real assets lower across the board. Copper miners down 3.6%, silver juniors off 4.6%.

**What it means:** One data point from a secondary economy doesn't change the structural inflation story. The UK is importing energy deflation from collapsed demand, not solving real scarcity. This is noise.

**Action:** Hold all positions. Use any further weakness to add to SILJ and SLV. The gold/silver ratio at 65x remains historically stretched — silver's volatility works both ways.

Meanwhile, China's "unprecedented oil stockpiling" and cyber attacks on US defense contractors signal the geopolitical powder keg remains lit. Energy security trumps temporary disinflation.

**Next catalyst:** US CPI data next week will matter more than UK noise.
