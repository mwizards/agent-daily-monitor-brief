## SIGNAL: Silver breaks out — SILJ rockets +5.5% while gold/silver ratio collapses to 64.7x

Silver juniors exploded higher with SILJ gaining 5.5% to $33.79, outpacing gold's solid 2.5% move. The gold/silver ratio dropped to 64.7x — continuing its march toward our sub-30x target as the monetary regime shift accelerates. Bonds rallied hard with 30Y yields falling 10bps to 4.72%.

**What it means:** The precious metals complex is rotating exactly as predicted. Silver's industrial demand plus monetary debasement is driving the catch-up trade we've been positioning for.

**Action:** SILJ holders stay put — this breakout has legs. Consider trimming gold miners into strength and adding silver exposure on any weakness.
