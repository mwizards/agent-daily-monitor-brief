# Energy Macro Morning Briefing — February 2, 2026

## SIGNAL: Gold crashes 10.3% as precious metals get annihilated

Silver gets obliterated — down 28.5% in what appears to be forced liquidation across the entire precious metals complex. Gold/silver ratio spikes to 58.31x as leveraged positions get margin-called. Every real asset getting hammered except energy.

**What it means:** This looks like a liquidity event, not a fundamental shift. DXY strength (+0.98%) and treasury selloff suggests dollar shortage dynamics. When everything correlates to 1, it's about funding, not fundamentals.

**Action:** If you have dry powder, this is the dip. Silver down 28% in a day is capitulation. Gold at $4,716 still up 3x from pre-2020 levels. The debasement thesis hasn't changed — the Fed will print again. Energy (XLE +1.07%) holding up shows real asset rotation, not collapse.
