## SIGNAL: Silver juniors explode +5.5% as Arctic tensions spike

Russia's military posturing along Finland's border sent precious metals screaming higher, with silver juniors (SILJ) leading the charge at +5.5%. Gold hit $4,952 while silver touched $74.80, driving the gold/silver ratio down to 66.21x. Bonds rallied hard — 30Y yields collapsed 10bps to 4.72% as flight-to-quality kicked in.

**What it means:** Geopolitical risk is back. When superpowers flex nuclear muscle, smart money runs to real assets. The silver move confirms our thesis that industrial metals with monetary properties will outperform in the new regime.

**Action:** Hold all precious metals positions. SILJ breakout validates the junior mining thesis. If you're underweight silver relative to gold, this pullback in the ratio is your window.
