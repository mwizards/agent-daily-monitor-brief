## SIGNAL: Silver juniors explode +5.53% as metals breakout accelerates

SILJ leading the charge with gold up 2.49% and silver up 2.94%. The gold/silver ratio dropped to 64.73x — still massively elevated but trending toward our sub-30x target. Bond yields falling across the curve with 30Y down 10bps signals the market pricing in monetary accommodation ahead.

**What it means:** The Easy Money 2.0 playbook is accelerating. Central banks can't fight both inflation AND financial system stress. They'll choose the system every time.

**Action:** SILJ breakout confirms the junior miners thesis. If you're underweight precious metals, this move isn't over. The ratio compression trade has 50% more to run.
