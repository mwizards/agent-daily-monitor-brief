## SIGNAL: Silver rockets 5.25% as nuclear headlines drive uranium +6.21%

Silver hit $70.19 while uranium miners exploded on ZeroHedge nuclear arms race coverage. Gold/silver ratio crashed to 63.25x — the lowest since the debasement trade began. 2Y yields fell 10bps as markets price monetary accommodation into geopolitical chaos.

**What it means:** The thesis is accelerating. Nuclear tensions drive strategic metal hoarding while falling yields signal the Fed's inflation fight is over. Silver's outperformance confirms monetary debasement is entering its next phase.

**Action:** Power Portfolio uranium exposure (URA, URNM) just delivered massive alpha. Silver positions (SLV, SILJ) breaking out toward thesis targets. Hold everything. Add on any weakness.
