## SIGNAL: Silver miners explode higher, SILJ +5.53%

Gold +2.49%, silver +2.94%, but silver juniors lead the charge at +5.53% as the gold/silver ratio compresses to 65.2x. Bonds rally hard with 30Y yields dropping 10bps to 4.72%. European civil war warnings from British military brass add urgency to the safe haven bid.

**What it means:** The monetary debasement trade is accelerating. Silver miners are leveraged plays on both metal prices and supply disruption — exactly what we want in this regime.

**Action:** SILJ breakout confirms the silver thesis. Hold all precious metals positions. This is thesis validation in real-time.
