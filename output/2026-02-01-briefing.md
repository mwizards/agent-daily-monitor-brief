# Energy Macro Morning Briefing — February 1, 2026

## SIGNAL: Gold -10.27%, Silver -28.54% — Real Assets Getting Crushed

Metals bloodbath across the board. Gold down $500+ to $4745, silver cratering below $80. All miners getting destroyed — uranium down 8%, copper miners off 10%. 

DXY up nearly 1% to 119.29 while yields hold steady. This isn't Fed policy driving dollar strength — this is safe haven flow as Iran tensions escalate. US warning Iran over live fire drills near American forces. Iranians reportedly sealing windows and storing food.

**What it means:** Short-term safe haven flows into dollars are overwhelming the debasement thesis. But fundamentals haven't changed — we're still printing money and energy remains scarce.

**Action:** Don't panic sell. This is exactly when weak hands fold and smart money accumulates. If you have dry powder, start scaling into positions. Silver at 60x ratio to gold is historically oversold.

**Next catalyst to watch:** Any escalation in Iran tensions or Fed communication from Warsh nomination.
