## SIGNAL: Silver explodes +8.33% as industrial metals surge across the board

Silver led a massive breakout in real assets with COPX up 5.14%, uranium miners (URNM) up 5.79%, and copper hitting $5.91/lb. The gold/silver ratio collapsed to 61.92x — continuing its march toward our sub-30x thesis target. France's defense chief declaring "we are preparing for war" and setting a 2030 timeline for European readiness adds fuel to the strategic metals fire.

**What it means:** The industrial metals complex is pricing in supply constraints and defense spending acceleration. Silver's outperformance signals the market is finally recognizing its dual role as both monetary metal and critical industrial input.

**Action:** SILJ holders are seeing the thesis play out in real time. Hold tight. This move looks like the start of something bigger, not the end.
