## SIGNAL: Silver rockets +5.25% as Iran tariffs trigger safe haven stampede

Trump's secondary tariffs on Iran-trading nations hit 25%, sparking geopolitical risk premium across real assets. Silver leading the charge at $76.90/oz with juniors (SILJ) exploding +7.23%. Uranium miners ripping +6.21% as nuclear energy gets repriced for energy security premium.

**What it means:** The monetary debasement trade is morphing into the energy security trade. Iran sanctions tighten oil supply, forcing acceleration toward domestic energy independence. Real assets pricing in supply chain disruption + currency debasement combo.

**Action:** SILJ and URA leading breakouts validate our thesis. Hold all positions. Gold/silver ratio at 64.76x still screaming "buy silver" versus our sub-30x target.
