## SIGNAL: Uranium miners crash 8.36% on nuclear arms control noise

URNM hit $70.06 after Trump signaled willingness to abandon nuclear arms control with Russia. URA down 6.91% to $52.39. Markets pricing in oversupply risk if nuclear weapons stockpiles get drawn down for civilian fuel.

**What it means:** Temporary noise around geopolitics. Nuclear power demand from AI data centers hasn't changed. China still building 150+ reactors. The uranium deficit is structural, not dependent on weapons-grade material flows.

**Action:** Use the dip. URNM below $75 is a gift. Add on weakness.

Meanwhile, silver ripped 2.88% to $79.18 while copper miners got hammered down 4.57%. Classic commodity rotation during uncertainty. Energy up 2.25% as crude draws continue — 229k barrel inventory decline last week.

Gold/silver ratio: 62.57x. Still way above our sub-30x target.
